        A <span>30 HOURS OF HACKATHON</span> competition for engineering students called Innovatio, which aims to find original, cutting-edge, and useful solutions to problems that actually exist in the real world. Teams of participants have a relatively short time to come up with an idea, design, build, and test a prototype. A solution to a problem, either for the general public or for a particular organisation, is what is intended to be produced. New technology learning, teamwork improvement, and networking with other participants could all be additional¬†goals.
